## Questions/Suggestions/Bug Reports
If you found this repository online and have a suggestion/bug report, I highly recommend you use [JMusicBot](https://jmusicbot.com) instead of this one. This bot was intended for private use and is not regularly monitored for issues. If you have a suggestion for this bot, it's best to contact tgrosson directly.

## Editing
jagrosh says: "[JMusicBot] (and the source code) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute." That being said, I'm not a Java developer, and I was eventually able to figure it out, so feel free to play around with the code if you wish. If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License, as was done for this bot.
